String hej = "I'm gonna come clean I have 5.45 inches one and I love this little guy, like its so easy to hold and move it doesn't feel like a bother at all. I know nowadays its all about big sizes but I still like the small ones, it fits perfectly in my hand. Now, one day when I was hanging with my homies and I noticed one of them had a 6.6 inches one and another had a 6.7 inches one. I looked around at other people's too and they all had a big one. I asked them if I can hold it, they said yes so I went around holding everyone's big \"device\". Some of them were white while some were black. I learned that day that its not only about length but about thickness too and the feel of it. But I still like little ones, I don't know how people even carry around those big ones! I mean there is no shame in having a small one, it doesn't matter if everyone have big ones!";
